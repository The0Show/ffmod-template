# Hello there! Welcome to the Furious Fletchlings resource modding project.
# Right now you can replace the music, a bug prevents sprites from working currently.

# You can replace the songs, while keeping the filenames. Be sure to change the loop point if needed.
# To change the loop point, select your song, go to the "Import" tab on the left, and change the loop offset. Then press "Reimport".

# When you're finished replacing the assets, run the project (click on the play button on the top right or press F5)

# You'll be presented with a screen. Check the boxes next to all of the files you want to include in the mod file.
# It's reccommended to only include files you've changed, to prevent overriding other mods unnecessarily or bloating the file size.

# Then, if you want, you can replace the title screen logo by typing the new text into the box.

# Once you're done, click on the "create ffmod file" button!
# Select a spot to save it (include the .ffmod extension manually), and then press save. Once finished, you'll see a popup box.

# Now you can import your mod into Furious Fletchlings by dragging and dropping it on the Settings screen!
